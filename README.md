# Flasforge_DreamerNX_Cura_Definition

Cura profile for Flashforge Dreamer NX.

To the right is added the Purge line. 
Since Cura doesn't allow you to add Skirt and Brim to both As a Prusaslicer (which I use mainly). 
Then I added a Prime line to activate the nozzle.

To add a profile, copy the "resources" directory to the installed
Cura directory on your computer.
